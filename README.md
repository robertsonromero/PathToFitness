# PathToFitness
Personal project that can calculate your Body mass index and daily caloric intake

This program creates a directory where it stores your personal information such as height, weight, age, and gender. You are able to update this information when ever you want within the program. I plan on adding more functions to the program so it is still a work in progress.
